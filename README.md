# TalesOfCondoria
A 2D rpg written from scratch using C# and Monogame. This was created as an assignment for my Game Development course. A player can load into the game and attack monsters until defeat. Although the game is unfinished, I created an initial framework to be able to add new content at a rapid pace. 

### How to run?
Run the executable file on Windows
