# TalesOfCondoria
A 2D rpg written from scratch using C# and Monogame. This was created as an assignment for my Game Development course. It demonstrates game state management,
animation, input, and audio. Although the game is unfinished, I created an initial framework to be able to add new content at a rapid pace. 

### How to run?
Run the executable file on Windows
